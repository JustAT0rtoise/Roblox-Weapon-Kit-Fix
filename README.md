# Roblox-Weapon-Kit-Fix
I‚Äôve seen lots of people having problems with Roblox‚Äôs Weapons Kit, mostly with its very annoying issue of locking your camera in 3rd person mode and over your shoulder. I myself used this kit in one of my old games, so I decided to make a (probably) complete fix for this weapon kit‚Äôs system. https://devforum.roblox.com/t/3064866

This asset fixes many issues, with the main ones being:
- Your camera returns to normal when you unequip weapons! No FOV, MoveSpeed, or tilt issues either.
- Fixed issues with not being able to damage R6 rigs or non-player humanoids.
- Fixed issues with explosion damage not being displayed correctly.

# Roblox-Weapon-Kit-Fix
I’ve seen lots of people having problems with Roblox’s Weapons Kit, mostly with its very annoying issue of locking your camera in 3rd person mode and over your shoulder. I myself used this kit in one of my old games, so I decided to make a (probably) complete fix for this weapon kit’s system. https://devforum.roblox.com/t/3064866
